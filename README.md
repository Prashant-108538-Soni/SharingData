Subject: Clarification Regarding Salary Increment and Correction for July 2025
Dear [Recipient's Name],
I hope this message finds you well.
As discussed earlier, I was expecting a correction in my salary starting July 2025. However, I have not yet received the increment letter, and the updated salary is not reflected in my pay.
Could you kindly inform me of the tentative timeline for receiving the increment letter and when the salary correction will be reflected? Additionally, I would appreciate clarification on the process for covering the adjustment for the month of July.
Thank you for your assistance and support.
Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Employee ID or Department, if applicable]
